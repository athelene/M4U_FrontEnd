          Memories For Us’ purpose is to keep people connected with those
          closest to them. It is not a platform for fame via viral posts. It is
          intended to be a positive environment for connection. Violence,
          harassment and other similar types of behavior discourage people from
          expressing themselves and interfere with such a positive experience.
          Our rules are to ensure all users can use the service in the spirit of
          a positive connection with others.

          <h4>Enforcement and Appeals</h4>
          Learn more about our approach to enforcement, including potential
          consequences for violating these rules or attempting to circumvent
          enforcement, as well as how to appeal. Advertising Memories For Us
          does not allow advertising. You may not post content that is
          explicitly intended to sell a product or service.

          <strong>Note:</strong> we may need to change these rules from time to
          time in order to support our goal of promoting a healthy public
          conversation. The most current version is always available from the
          menu in the Memories For Us service.

          <h4>Enforcement</h4>
          We may take enforcement actions because the behavior violates the
          Memories For Us Rules. Other times, it may be in response to a valid
          and properly scoped request from an authorized government entity
          according to a lawful order. Below are some of the enforcement actions
          that we may take.

          <h5>Memory-level enforcement</h5>
          We take action at the Memory level to ensure that we are not being
          overly harsh with an otherwise healthy account that made a mistake and
          violated our rules. In such cases, we will remove the memory in
          question. Requiring Memory removal: When we determine that a Memory
          violated the Memories For Us Rules, we require the violator to remove
          it before they can use the Memories For Us service again. We send an
          email notification to the violator identifying the Memory(ies) in
          violation and which policies have been violated. They will then need
          to go through the process of removing the violating Tweet. Hiding a
          violating Memory while awaiting its removal: In the interim period
          between when Memories For Us takes enforcement action and the person
          removes the Memory, we hide that Memory from public view.

          <h5>Account-level enforcement</h5>
          We take action at the account level if we determine that a person has
          violated the Memories For Us Rules in a particularly egregious way, or
          has repeatedly violated them even after receiving notifications from
          us. Requiring media or profile edits: If an account’s profile or media
          content is not compliant with our policies, we may make it temporarily
          unavailable and require that the violator edit the media or
          information in their profile to come into compliance. We also explain
          which policy their profile or media content has violated. Verifying
          account ownership: To ensure that violators do not abuse the anonymity
          we offer and harass others on the platform, we may require the account
          owner to verify ownership with a phone number or email address. This
          also helps us identify violators who are operating multiple accounts
          for abusive purposes and take action on such accounts. Note that when
          an account has been locked pending completion of a challenge (such as
          being required to provide a phone number), it is not available to any
          other user account. Permanent suspension: This is our most severe
          enforcement action. Permanently suspending an account will remove it
          from use, and the violator will not be allowed to create new accounts.
          When we permanently suspend an account, we notify people that they
          have been suspended for abuse violations, and explain which policy or
          policies they have violated and which content was in violation.
          Violators can appeal permanent suspensions if they believe we made an
          error. They can do this by emailing support@memoriesforus.com. Upon
          appeal, if we find that a suspension is valid, we respond to the
          appeal with information on the policy that the account has violated.

          Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make
          reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with
          your account or the next time you attempt to access your account,
          depending on the circumstances. In all such cases, the Terms shall
          terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the
          Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply:
          II, III, V, and VI. If you believe your account was terminated in
          error you can file an appeal by emailing support@memoriesforus.com.
          For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms survive the deactivation or
          termination of your account.

          <h4>General</h4>
          We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be
          retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms, which will
          always be at login.memoriesforus.com/tos, will govern our relationship
          with you. We will try to notify you of material revisions, for example
          via a service notification or an email to the email associated with
          your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those
          revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised
          Terms. The laws of the State of Kansas, excluding its choice of law
          provisions, will govern these Terms and any dispute that arises
          between you and Memories For Us. All disputes related to these Terms
          or the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts
          located in Kansas, United States, and you consent to personal
          jurisdiction and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum. In the
          event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or
          unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to
          the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these
          Terms will remain in full force and effect. Memories For Us’ failure
          to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a
          waiver of such right or provision. These Terms are an agreement

          We require certain information to provide our services to you. For
          example, you must have an account in order to upload or share content
          on Memories For Us. When you choose to share the information below
          with us, we collect and use it to operate our services.

          <h4>Basic Account Information</h4>
          You must create an account to use all Memories For Us features. When
          you create an account, you must provide us with some personal data so
          that we can provide our services to you. On Memories For Us this
          includes a display name (how you want others to see your name), a
          password, and an email address. Your display name is always public,
          but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym

          <h4>Public Information</h4>
          Most activity on Memories For Us is for the purpose of sharing with
          others, including your profile information, your Memories and certain
          information about your Memories like the date, time you created your
          Memory. When you share audio or visual content on our service, we may
          analyze that data to operate our services, for example by providing
          audio transcription. Memories you Like are also available to others in
          your circles. Memories For Us cannot prevent users in your Circles
          from copying or saving pictures of their screen with your information
          allowing them to share it outside Memories For Us. You are responsible
          for your Memories and other information you provide through our
          services, and you should think carefully about what you make available
          to others, especially if it is sensitive information. If you update
          your information on Memories For Us, such as by deleting a Memory, a
          Book or deactivating your account, we will reflect your updated
          content on Memories For Us. By posting content, you are directing us
          to disclose that information per your current Circles settings.

          <h4>Contact Information</h4>
          We use your contact information, such as your email address, to
          authenticate your account and keep it - and our services - secure, and
          to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. Subject to your settings, we
          also use contact information to enable certain account features (for
          example, for login verification), to send you information about our
          services, and to personalize our services. If you provide us with your
          phone number, you agree to receive text messages from Memories For Us
          to that number as your country’s laws allow. Memories For Us also uses
          your contact information to market to you as your country’s laws
          allow, and to help others find your account. If you email us, we will
          keep the content of your message, your email address, and your contact
          information to respond to your request.

          <h4>Payment Information</h4>
          You may provide us with payment information, including your credit or
          debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing
          address, for your subscription payments or other offerings provided as
          part of our services. If you make a payment or send money using
          Memories For Us features or services, including through an
          intermediary, we may receive information about your transaction such
          as when it was made or when a subscription is set to expire or
          auto-renew.
